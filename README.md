# A Cortical Computing Model towards Explainable Artificial Intelligence

<p>The Artificial Cortical Network (ACN) model Python library. It contains support for running the tools on sample dataset from different tests. 

<p>A new collection of coritcal model packages are now available, offering seamless experience for analysis and comparison with two other neural methods such as  LSTM and TDNN. 
The library include notebook implementations allowing simple testing of the library as well as running and improving on the implementation.

## Code
We have implemented the ACN library and we have compared it with two artificial neural models, TDNN and LSTM. The notebooks can be used to directly run and test the performance.

### Artificial Cortical Network (ACN)  
The notebook implements the trmaining and testing of the ACN model with the synthetic dataset. The performance on each of the datasets is outlined as result

### LSTM
The notebook implements the training and testing of the LSTM model with the synthetic dataset. The performance on each of the datasets is outlined as result

### TDNN
The notebook implements the training and testing of the TDNN model with the synthetic dataset. The performance on each of the datasets is outlined as result

## Datasets

### Dataset 1

Arithmetic operations involving addition and subtraction of single digits, with each digit or operation separated by blank symbol(s).

- Train dataset : Addition and subtraction of digits separated by signle blank symbol
- Test dataset : Addition and subtraction of digits separated by randon number of blank symbols 


```python

```

### Dataset 2
10 sets of addition and subtraction of digits separated by single blank symbol, spliting them as follows

- Train Dataset 2: Randomly chosen 100 out of 110 additions and subtractions of digits separated by single blank symbol

- Test Dataset 2: Remaining 10 out of 110 additions and subtractions of digits separated by randon number of blank symbols

### Dataset 3

- *Train Dataset 3*: Arithmetic operations involving addition and subtraction of single digits, with each digit or operation separated by a single blank symbol.

- Test Dataset 3: Arithmetic operations involving one or two additions or subtractions of single digits, with digits or operations separated by a random number of blank symbols.
